# Cluest-Prototype
Prototype for geolocation app using React Native

I'm using Expo for this, so it's probably easiest if you use it as well.

You'll need to install a couple of modules in addition to node.js and expo client in order to do this: aws amplify, redux, and react native should be everything for now.

If you have problems installing or running Expo, try running "npm cache clean --force" then "npm update" if you're running windows. Sometimes thing just seem to get stuck otherwise.
